### Reaction Speed Test!  
# What is it?  
This is my first complete pygame project, a reaction speed tester!  
It will give the user a series of 15 randomly located buttons to press. (Except for the first one, which is always placed in the middle.)  
This is done as there is timer which finishes when you successfully press all the buttons, that then finds the average of how long it takes for one button.  
It is for anyone wanting to practice or see if they have a good reaction time.  
# How to play? (As of the initial ship it is only a video demo)  
Simply press all the buttons as fast as you can!  
# How was this project made?  
This project was made with the help of many tutorials, as well as my own components that have been added.
